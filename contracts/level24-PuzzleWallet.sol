        // the best practice to have the same storage layout
        // So what we want to do is to change the `maxBalance` that will change (because it will write in the proxy state)
        // the value of `admin`. We just need to conert the player1 address to a uint256 by casting it to `uint256(player1Address)`

        // The problem is that before being able to change the maxValue we need to find a way to drain the balance in the
        // proxy contract otherwise the tx for `setMaxBalance(uint256(player1Address))` will revert

        // If we look at the `multicall` method we see that there is a check to prevent to call multiple times `deposit`
        // That check is needed because otherwise you would be able to send 1 ETH but call multiple X time deposit
        // and even if you have just sent 1 ETH the `balances[msg.sender]` would be updated X time

        // So we have the restriction to be able to call `deposit` only 1 time in the multicall
        // But what if in the same multicall we call another multicall (a multicall-inception!)
        // in this way we are able to call two times the deposit but sending only the amount of ETH for one!

        // But `balances[player]` is equal to 0.002 ether!
        // We are able to call the `execute` method in a way that will send to us the whole contract's balance
        puzzleWallet.execute(player, 0.002 ether, "");

        // Now that the balance is 0 we can call the `setMaxBalance`. Always for the same reason (not having the same storage layout)
        // when we execute the code on the implementation we are updating the slot1 (maxBalance) but on the proxy contract.
        // In the proxy contract the slot1 is used by the `admin` state variable.

empty the contract
